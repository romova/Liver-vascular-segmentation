# Vascular segmentation in the liver

Usind 3DIrcad dataset to segment vascular structures inside and around the liver with U-Net neural network.
1. Downland dataset using file downland_dircad.ipynb
2. Downland zip files: experiment1.zip for small U-Net arcitecture,
                       experiment2.zip for medium U-Net arcitecture,
                       experiment3.zip for large U-Net arcitecture.
3. Change the code in the file Vascular_segmentation.ipynb for work with the chosen segmented structure. (Originaly for artery segmentation with medium U-Net architecture)
